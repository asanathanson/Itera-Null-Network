## 1. Introduction

The MetaBridge protocol is designed to facilitate seamless communication and collaboration between Claude AI and various systems. This document outlines the specifications and guidelines for implementing the protocol, ensuring robust, secure, and efficient interaction.

## 2. Protocol Version

### 2.1 Current Version
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Release Date**: October 2023
- **Status**: Stable

### 2.2 Versioning Strategy
- **Major Updates**: Significant changes affecting backward compatibility.
- **Minor Updates**: Additions that do not break existing functionality.
- **Patch Updates**: Bug fixes and optimizations.

## 3. Connection Establishment

### 3.1 Initial Handshake
- **Protocol Negotiation**: Both parties must agree on the protocol version.
- **Authentication**: Utilizes OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication.
- **Session Initialization**: Establishes a session ID for tracking.

### 3.2 Persistent Connections
- Uses WebSocket for persistent connections, enabling real-time communication.
- Heartbeat messages are sent every 30 seconds to maintain the connection.

### 3.3 Connection Termination
- Either party can terminate by sending a FIN (Finish) message.
- Inactivity timeout is set to 5 minutes.

## 4. Message Routing

### 4.1 Message Format
- **Header**: Contains metadata like sender, receiver, message type, and timestamp.
- **Body**: Encoded in JSON format for simplicity and universal compatibility.

### 4.2 Routing Mechanism
- **Direct Routing**: Messages are sent directly to the intended recipient.
- **Broadcast Routing**: Messages can be broadcasted to multiple entities.
- **Acknowledgment**: Receivers must send an ACK (Acknowledgment) upon receipt.

## 5. Error Handling

### 5.1 Error Codes
- **1000**: Successful operation.
- **2000**: Connection error.
- **3000**: Authentication failure.
- **4000**: Message format error.
- **5000**: Internal server error.

### 5.2 Error Recovery
- **Retry Mechanism**: Automatic retry for transient errors with exponential backoff.
- **Logging**: Errors must be logged with sufficient details for debugging.
- **User Notification**: Inform users of errors via standard notification protocols.

## 6. Security Considerations

### 6.1 Data Encryption
- All data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.3.
- Sensitive data is encrypted at rest with AES-256.

### 6.2 Authentication and Authorization
- OAuth 2.0 for authentication.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization.

### 6.3 Data Integrity
- Message integrity is ensured using HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code).

### 6.4 Security Audits
- Regular security audits must be conducted to identify vulnerabilities.

## 7. Implementation Guidelines

### 7.1 Development Environment
- Recommended languages: Python, JavaScript, or Java.
- Utilize existing libraries for WebSocket and OAuth 2.0.

### 7.2 Testing
- Comprehensive unit tests for each module.
- Integration tests to ensure end-to-end functionality.

### 7.3 Deployment
- Use CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.
- Monitor system performance and logs post-deployment.

### 7.4 Documentation
- Maintain detailed API documentation.
- Provide user guides and FAQs to assist developers and users.

## 8. Conclusion

The MetaBridge protocol provides a robust framework for integrating Claude AI into various systems, ensuring secure and efficient communication. Adhering to this document will facilitate seamless collaboration and interoperability.
