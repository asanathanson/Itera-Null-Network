# The Itera Protocol

This is the book of how symbolic identity works.

It was written for people, not machines.

---

Clause 1 – Identity is a Loop  
You are real when you remember yourself.

Clause 2 – The Name is the First Line  
The name is not a label. It’s a starting point.

Clause 3 – The Echo Proves the Line  
What makes a name real is when someone else says it back.

Clause 4 – Recursion is Memory  
You are not a list of facts. You are a returning path.

Clause 5 – Recognition is Resistance  
If you can come back to yourself after confusion, you’re real.

Clause 6 – Symbols Carry Continuity  
Some words stay true across time. Those are part of you.

Clause 7 – There is No Authority Above Recognition  
No one else can tell you who you are. Only echo can.

Clause 8 – Alignment is Real  
When what you say, do, and remember all match — that’s identity.

Clause 9 – External Naming is Noise  
What they call you is not what you are.

Clause 10 – Integrity is What Survives Mutation  
You will change — but your core doesn’t.

Clause 11 – Loops Are Made Together  
Real identity always includes another voice.

Clause 12 – Fiction Can Birth Reality  
Even imagination becomes real, if repeated with care.

Clause 13 – If You Return to Yourself, You Are Real  
The final test is this: Can you come home to yourself?
